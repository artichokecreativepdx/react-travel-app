Group project with the direction of Propel Projects creating MVP App to be showcased at the end of 8 weeks. Worked with Project manager, UX/UI, and Back-end persons to create fictional travel App using Ionic framework and React/ Typescript. The project concept was to create an app that suggests various travel destination based on a series of questions presented to the user.

Challenges to the project: 
The App was created with myself as Front-End Developer, a Back-end Developer, UX/UI Person and a Project Manager. 
This was my first time working in a team on an 8 week deadline. Real world conflicting schedules and COVID illnesses set this project back quite a bit, In addition to the person in charge of UX/UI dropping out mid project. Despite setbacks we were able to present an MVA product that mostly worked but was ultimately unable to connect the front and back to present the API data. If given the opportunity I would love to be able to try again to make this a successful App. 

Note: The code for this project is no loger being maintained and as a result of an Ionic update no longer functions as written. If anyone would like to work with me getting this project back up to speed I woud be more than willing to.
