Group project with the direction of Propel Projects creating MVP App to be showcased at the end of 8 weeks. Worked with Project manager, UX/UI, and Back-end persons to create fictional travel App using Ionic framework and React/ Typescript. The project concept was to create an app that suggests various travel destination based on a series of questions presented to the user.
